    <h1>BandScrape needs YOU!!!</h1>
    <p>
        BandScrape is a community-based project - you're the one who decides whether it works or not.
        That's why I'm asking you to help out.
    </p>
    <p>
        You need nothing but a computer with internet access!
        The computer doesn't have to be a $5000 maxed out workstation, nor does your internet have to be top-of-the-line fiber optic.
        This will work just about anywhere, seriously.
        It uses almost no bandwidth or system resources at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        All you need to get started is the BandScrape client.
        Download it for your favorite platform down below and just start it up.
        That's all.
        Leave it running for however long you want!
        The longer you run it for, the better and bigger your contribution is (&lt;3).
        Just make sure you're not running it on multiple devices that are on the same network (share the same public IP address).

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>Get away from me, that's sketchy as hell, why should I run that?</h3>
    <p>
        I would be paranoid, too.
        That's why I've made everything <a href="https://github.com/ivabru0/bandscrape">open-source</a>!
        If you can read code or have someone you trust who can, it's all out there so you know exactly what you're running.
    </p>
    <h3>Okay, why is my antivirus going crazy then?</h3>
    <p>
        Because they tend to <s>really suck</s> flag random programs like these as PUP.
        They follow the mentality of "better safe than sorry" and unfortunately go crazy on unsigned stuff like this, even if nothing is malicious.
        If you still trust me, give the program an exception or disable your antivirus entirely.
    </p>
    <h3>Okay, why is my Mac going crazy then?</h3>
    <p>
        Similar reasoning, but here it's Apple themselves not allowing anything greenlit by them to run at all.
        Give <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unknown-developer-mh40616/mac">this</a> a shot.
